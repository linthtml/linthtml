## cli

- allow absolute path "linthtml /root/xx/xx/my.html"
- allow realtive path with ".." "linthtml ../my.html"

## refactor

- [✔️] [0.5.0][inline-config] Remove `preset=`, `${preset}`
- [ ] [0.5.0][inline-config] Remove `$previous`
- [✔️] [0.5.0] Remove speudo `line` rule
- [✔️] [0.5.0?] Activate rule using string "on"
- [ ] [0.5.0] Improve inline_config extraction
  - (rule1 rule2=config) (extract rule1 and rule2)
  - (rule1= rule2=config) (extract rule1 and rule2)
  - (rule1=config rule1) (extract rule1 and rule2)
    Use parser ?
- [ ] add a rule to enforce href on links
- [ ] rename rule `link-min-length-4` in `link-min-length` and add a length option
- [ ] `raw-ignore-text` Find a better solution than the current one
- [ ] Get rid of the process function in rules. Config send to rules should be the same as the one defined in the config file
      This funciton should be changed for a validation function that raise errors if config is not valid
- [✔️] No rules by default
- [ ] Tests should assert issues too (code, position...)
- [✔️] move rules tests in the rule folder

## New rules

- [ ] no-script-head -> Forbid the use of `script` tag in the head tag
- [ ] no-style-tag -> Forbid the use of `style` tag
- [ ] no-inline-javascript -> Forbid the use of JS code inside a tag attribute
- [ ] no-inline-style -> forbid the use `style` attribute on tag

## deprecate rules

- [ ] input-radio-req-name can be merged with input-req-name (don't exist yet)
- [ ] indent-delta don't understand this rule
- [ ] raw-ignore-regex it's no really a rule (maybe a options for the linter, but i'm not sure we should keep this option)
- [ ] maxerr convert in max maxWarn instead ?
- [ ] id-class-style
- [ ] attr-new-line: Get rid of "0+"

## Fix rules naming convention

- complete mane :
  - req => require
  - len => length
  - dup => duplicate

## Correct rules

- [ ] `button-req-content` should check for aria-labelledby too
- [ ] Rename `input-btn-req-value-or-title` (message from axe "Input buttons must have discernible text")
- [ ] Merge `attr-name-style` and `attr-name-ignore-regex` (this one should be an option of the first)
- [ ] `attr-req-value` should report an error for empty values (`''` or `""`). Can be an option like `strict`
- [ ] `attr-req-value` should permit to whitelist attributes that can have no value (default should be boolean attributes like `disable`)
- [ ] `attr-validate` should not accept `\b` `\t` in attributes's value
- [ ] `class-style` get rid of `bem` format ? Tests seems not valid and it's hard to tel what's BEM or not
- [ ] merge `doctype-first` and `doctype-html5` (html5 should be an option (should be be default too ?))
- [ ] `doctype-first` `smart` should be an option. `smart` should not report if doctype + html + head not present ?
- [ ] `doctype-first` should return an error if first element is plain text (plain text is in fact a textNode)
- [ ] `fig-req-figcaption`report error when figcaption is empty
- [ ] `focusable-tab-index-style` rename the rule
- [ ] `id-class-no-ad` deprecate this one ? Why not allow `ad`, `social`... in id or class ? (Can be replaced by a rule that ban word in attributes (using a regexp))
- [ ] `attr-new-line` value of 0 should not allow one attribut per line. Config should only accept >=1 ?

## Improve inline config

- [✔️] The `preset` thing is totally overkill, hard to understand >< and not documented very well.
- [ ] The `$previous` thing is totally overkill and hard to understand >< , Maybe we can keep this one).
- [✔️] Add `.linthtml-disable ?[rules]` and `.linthtml-enable ?[rules]`

`linthtml-configure` should accept only one rule, something like

`linthtml-configure [rule] [value]`

## Coming "soon"

- [ ] Tests for the `cli`.
- [ ] Nice/cute logo (because every projects should have one)
- [ ] A website + online documentation to make it easier for everyone to use LintHTML. (The website will be accessible and available in as many language as possible)
- [ ] Translated `cli`. Like the website the `cli` should be available in as many language as possible
- [✔️] Improved config file. The current config file format is not good and should be improved. (Should definitively looks like [eslint](https://eslint.org), [stylelint](http://stylelint.io/), [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)...) (planned for the version 0.3.0)
- [ ] Rules naming guideline (like the one from [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/about-rules/))
- [✔️] Warning level for rules.
- [ ] Plugins (there's already a plugins system inherited from HtmlLint but it's not documented and tested so 🤫)
- [ ] Man pages for the cli ? (https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#directoriesman)
- [ ] More to come 🤷‍♀️

## inline config

`linthtml-enable, linthtml-disable, linthtml-configure` cannot be use to activate new rules
only affect configured rules (already defined before)

<div>
  <div>
    foo // not ignored
    {{!-- linthtml-disable rule=config --}}
    <div>
      foo // ignored
    </div>
    foo // ignored
  </div>
  foo // not ignored
</div>
